1. For Users, Score dashboard,
    - Till now users are only allowed to see number of quiz attempts, only after quiz expiry date.
    - Also User won't be able to distinguish attempted and non-attempted before.
    - The new feature allows the user to see his/hers quiz attempt count, thus can concentrate on un-attempted quizzes (if want to)
    - For this, a function added in the utils files to get the quiz and attempt count numbers.
2. For Users, a user profile window created.
    - The registration details, excluding password can be seen here.
    - Also, they can see the different quizzes the attended.
3. User's Scores dashboard,
    - Previously users can't see their attempted quiz score on this page, now they can.
    - Removed 'Date" feature and added 'Final Score'
    - To get the date of the expired quizzes, 'View Reult' page haves it.
4. Adde 'checksum.py' in the root directory for checksum validation during viva.
5. 'required' attribute attaed to aviod errors while filling forms.
6. Still there is one issue I found,
    - On editing the Subject name, clicking save tried to add and commit.
    - If have to rectify the issue we can have a if-else statement to check existancce of the sunject name in the db using 'ilike()' function.
    - If with this approach, if any error pops-up, we have to check that one too at the time.
7. 'routes.py',
    - Might look like a lot of changes in code, but actually NONE.
    - Only arranged code in different sections for readability.
    - Admin related routes are arranged at one place, and similar for Users.
8. Files for environment creation added,
    - 'environment.yml' for creating conda environment.
    - 'requirements.txt' for creating environment using Python.
9. A detailed README file created for smooth execution of the application, from downloading to running it on local.
10. Added a background image on the front pages, ie on home, login and in registration pages.
11. Till now, we can try to register a new user using the admin's username,
    - Results error generation on html, becuse of trying to committing without validating the unique field.
    - Now, the username is also getting checked against role 'Admin' also to avoid this error.
